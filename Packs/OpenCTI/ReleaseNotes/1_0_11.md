#### Integrations

##### OpenCTI

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/vendors-sdk:1.0.0.92984*.
- filters object in the get_indicators function changed according to the new version of OpenCTI
not inserting parameters to the command opencti_get_indicators created a bug - fixed by changing the default in this case to filter "ALL"
by those changes the "test-module" button is fixed.
bug fix: inserting just score_end or just score_start in the command created an error, now when inserting just one of them, there are default value for each value. added some tests for those cases mentioned above
