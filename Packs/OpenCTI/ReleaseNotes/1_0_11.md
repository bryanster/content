#### Integrations

##### OpenCTI

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/vendors-sdk:1.0.0.92984*.
- Switched **opencti-get-indicators** command to work with version 5.12 of OpenCTI.
- not inserting parameters to the command opencti_get_indicators created a bug - fixed by changing the default in this case to filter "ALL".
- By those changes the "test-module" button is fixed.
- Added default values for **score_end** and **just** score_start in the **opencti-get-indicators** command.
