##### EWS v2

- Fixed an issue in the ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **parse_incident_from_item** that 
  could result in duplicated headers in EML file results.
- Fixed an issue so that EML files downloaded from ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **parse_incident_from_item** will now
  retain CRLF line separators
